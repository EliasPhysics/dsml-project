# Transformers for time series prediction

This project is developed for the Dynamical systems and machine learning lecture at the University of Heidelberg in WS25.
It uses the method proposed by [Wu et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08317) for time series prediciotn using transformers.
This implementation follows the tutorial provided by [TowardsDataScience](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-make-a-pytorch-transformer-for-time-series-forecasting-69e073d4061e), implemented by
[KasperGroesLudvigsen/influenza_transformer](https://github.com/KasperGroesLudvigsen/influenza_transformer)
